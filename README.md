A Minecraft pathfinder bot. This project is an updated version of [MineBot](https://github.com/leijurv/MineBot/),
the original version of the bot for Minecraft 1.8, rebuilt for 1.12.2. Baritone focuses on reliability and particularly performance (it's over [29x faster](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/pull/180#issuecomment-423822928) than MineBot at calculating paths).

# Chat control
[Defined Here](src/main/java/baritone/utils/ExampleBaritoneControl.java)

Quick start example: `thisway 1000` or `goal 70` to set the goal, `path` to actually start pathing. Also try `mine diamond_ore`. `cancel` to cancel.

# API example

```
BaritoneAPI.getSettings().allowSprint.value = true;
BaritoneAPI.getSettings().pathTimeoutMS.value = 2000L;

// Note that at this moment in time the Goal implementations are not exposed in the API
BaritoneAPI.getPathingBehavior().setGoal(new GoalXZ(10000, 20000));
BaritoneAPI.getPathingBehavior().path();
```

# FAQ

## Can I use Baritone as a library in my hacked client?

Sure! (As long as usage is in compliance with the LGPL 3 License)

## How is it so fast?

Magic. (Hours of [Leijurv](https://github.com/leijurv) enduring excruciating pain)

## Why is it called Baritone?

It's named for FitMC's deep sultry voice.
