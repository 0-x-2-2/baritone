# Setup

## Prebuilt
[Releases](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/releases)

Not always completely up to date with latest features.

The forge release (currently `baritone-forge-1.1.3.jar`) can simply be added as a Forge mod.

Previously (Baritone v1.1.2 and below), it was not fully compatible with the latest version of Forge. `freeLook` was broken in Forge 14.23.4.2744. Forge 14.23.4.2743 or **older** worked with Baritone v1.1.2 and lower. Newer versions of Forge "worked", sort of, but Baritone's movement became unreliable and `freeLook` must be off.

## Build it yourself
- Clone or download Baritone

## Artifacts

Building Baritone will result in 4 artifacts created in the ``dist`` directory.

- **Forge**: Forge mod
- **API**: Only the non-api packages are obfuscated. This should be used in environments where other mods would like to use Baritone's features.
- **Standalone**: Everything is obfuscated. This should be used in environments where there are no other mods present that would like to use Baritone's features.
- **Unoptimized**: Nothing is obfuscated. This shouldn't be used ever in production.

## More Info
To replace out Impact 4.4's Baritone build with a customized one, switch to the `impact4.4-compat` branch, build Baritone as above then copy `dist/baritone-api-$VERSION$.jar` into `minecraft/libraries/cabaletta/baritone-api/1.0.0/baritone-api-1.0.0.jar`, replacing the jar that was previously there. You also need to edit `minecraft/versions/1.12.2-Impact_4.4/1.12.2-Impact_4.4.json`, find the line `"name": "cabaletta:baritone-api:1.0.0"`, remove the comma from the end, and entirely remove the line that's immediately after (starts with `"url"`).
